ForkTheMedia
============

Sick of the poor quality of news coverage in the media? Do something about it! ForkTheMedia!

How do I do it?
---------------

ForkTheMedia uses Github's common workflow for Open Source development to take a piece of news, in this case the repository is meant for Articles, update the content to have more information (cite your sources!), and commit it to the repository. Don't like someone else's take on updating the content in question? No problem, [fork it](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/), and improve it!

Alternatively, you can write your own news story from scratch.

Isn't this a violation of copyright?
------------------------------------

First, I'm not a lawyer, so what I'm saying may be a poor interpretation of copyright law. I see this project as a form of civil disobedience and in this way I don't care if I'm breaking copyright law. So ask yourself where you stand on this and do your own homework on whether you are breaking copyright (or if you care).

Having said that, here is my interpretation:

This project is not-for-profit and a form of critism of the original works and thus I maintain it is [fair use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use).

Laws may differ in other countries, but I suspect that since Github is in the US, US law would likely apply.

Why?
----

I, like so many people I know, am frustrated by reading media coverage that devotes too little effort toward substantive coverage of what's going on in the world. One Saturday morning, after reading about [#OccupyWallStreet](http://occupywallstreet.org) and realizing that I hadn't heard much about what is actually going on, I decided to see if I could improve an article to add more indepth information to it. It clicked that git and Github would be an easy way to allow for collective engagment. Thus ForkTheMedia.
